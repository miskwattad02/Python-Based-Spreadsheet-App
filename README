with simple examples provided for each function's usage (examples are provided within the input equation box,
please refer to them before usage).

4 - Undo/redo functionality - Use Ctrl + Z or Ctrl + Y to undo or redo text entry in each text box.

5 - Support for importing data from external sources - CSV, PDF, JSON, YAML, Excel.

6 - Support for exporting sheets to various formats - CSV, PDF, JSON, YAML, Excel.

7 - Automatic cell filling by dragging a neighboring cell containing a formula.

8 - Automatic function filling by selecting cells where a specific function needs to be activated,
then clicking on the desired function.



Key Points:

The program is divided into 5 different files, each representing its category, making the program modular.
This allows for the addition or removal of features independently of other features,
following the principles of object-oriented programming, especially evident in function nine.
Exception handling using try/except blocks to handle all user-input errors based on their specific conditions.
The "ImprovedCell" class: I pondered on how to build a cell with additional properties
and functionalities not present in tkinter. This led me to learn about building a wrapper class
to contain the tkinter Entry and other customizations specific to my program.
